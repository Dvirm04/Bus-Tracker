# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description: 
This repository contains the code for a map animation web page. The code contains a marker that moves through the coordinates for all bus stops between the MIT campus and the Harvard campus when the user presses the "Move Bus" button upon page load.  

## How to Run:
Clone the full repository to reside in a single registry. Replace the MapBox access token with your own in the mapanimation.js file. 

## Roadmap of Future Improvements: 
The functionality of the mapanimation.js can be improved in many ways. One improvement is to have it act as a full map of the world and give ETAs depending on traffic and times of day by using real time data.
